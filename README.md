# Algorithm and Programming - Final Project : MULTIPLAYER BATTLESHIP
Battleship is a fun classic where two or more players go against each other in a psychological and strategic battle against each other to destroy all of the opponent's ships.

## Installation


## Running The Program
To install battleship you need python 3, I recommend python 3.7 and above [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Get pygame by entering this command on your terminal
`python -m pip install pygame`

Lastly, all you need to run this program is to run the main.py file.
